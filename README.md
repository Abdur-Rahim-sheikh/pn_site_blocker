# Blocking pn site.
<p>
Many muslim and brother's of deen who is not enlighten from his childhood.<br>
Rather he came to deen at his college or university life. Leaves all his <br> wrong doing and shape himself in the standard of deen. But one sin many cannot<br> leave. Which is addiction to porn.
</p>

Why we cannot do that because it's availabe in our fingertip. It's free.<br>
So when we get alone, when it's dark. We cannot restrain ourselve and commit <br> the sin. Guilt sorrounds us from everywhere after the event. We repent and the next night same sin happens.<br>

When I read "Mukto Bataser khoje" [pdf](https://www.docdroid.net/qx6xK8K/mukt-bataser-khonnje-pdf#page=7) it touched my heart. Only if the pn sites <br> were unavailable to us. 

I have made a script for computer. If we ran the script on our computer <br>
It will block those sites.
1) No browser can access them.
2) Neither incognito can access them.

* Still vulnerable to virtual private network

## Steps to Execute.

i.e
    ```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    ```

3. **Run the Script**: Make the script executable and run it using the following commands:

    ```bash
    chmod +x block_sites.sh.x
    ./block_sites.sh.x
    ```
